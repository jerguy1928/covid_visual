# covid_visual
This project is a live data visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic. This map shows various statistics for each country involved in the COVID-19 pandemic, including Rankings, Total Cases, Active Cases, etc.

This app collects data via a web scraper(ran periodically) from Worldometers. This data is then organized into a Geojson and is processed via some Javascript.

You can view the scraper (written in Python) above.

To view the app please go to:
